# Chess Engine Project

A Rust chess engine, vibe-coded by chat. Designed to grow incrementally toward GM-level standard chess strength via classical eval first, then NNUE.

Variant chess is **explicitly out of scope** for this project — it will be a future fork.

## Current status

**Phase: M1 complete (M1.G landed); M2 next — UCI random mover.** Architectural commitments settled (see `docs/decisions/`).

### What M1.G landed

The `perft` module — move-generation validation + measurement:

- **`src/perft.rs`** with `perft`, `perft_bulk` (CPW depth-1 leaf-skip), `divide` (UCI-sorted), `perft_categorized` (internal-only category counts per ADR-0006), and the `PerftCounts` struct.
- **Recursion driver** `perft_inner<const BULK: bool>` monomorphized over plain/bulk; the leaf-skip branch is dead-code-eliminated from the plain path.
- **Stockfish-regenerated fixtures** — canonical 6 D1–D6 + 174-position Whittington corpus D1–D4. Per ADR-0006 Stockfish 18 is the sole oracle; `scripts/regen-perft-fixtures.sh` reproduces them.
- **Test partition** — D1–D3 (all 6 positions, plain + bulk parity) + light-D4 fast (`cargo test`); heavy-D4, D5, D6, Whittington D4 `#[ignore]`-gated. Default fast suite finishes in 0.02s release.
- **`criterion 0.7` benchmark harness** — `benches/perft.rs` + `benches/movegen.rs`; first baseline at `bench/m1.g.md`. Format ratified by **ADR-0010**.
- **M1.F smoke benchmark deleted** — criterion supersedes it.

### M1.G — verification (Apple M4, dev machine)

| Metric | Result |
|---|---|
| Tests | 446 fast + 9 ignored. All ignored verified to pass: D4-heavy 0.23s; D5 + Whittington 2.47s combined; **D6 117.93s** (~22B nodes). |
| `cargo build --release` | clean |
| `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` | clean |
| `cargo audit` + `cargo deny check` | clean |
| `cargo llvm-cov` (`perft.rs`) | 98.32% region / 98.25% line / 93.75% function. Crate total 95.19%. |
| **Headline throughput (`bench/m1.g.md`)** | starting D4 plain **33 Mnps**; starting D4 bulk **119 Mnps**; Kiwipete D3 bulk **168 Mnps**. Meets M1 ≥100 Mnps exit criterion on bulk path. |

All four loops (plan, test-suite, final code+tests, benchmark capture) converged. Plan archived at `docs/plans/m1.g.md`. ADR-0010 codifies the bench-baseline format.

### What's next

**M2 — Random-mover engine speaking UCI.** Plays legal random moves through Cute Chess. Establishes the UCI skeleton, time-management harness, and tournament tooling before any search complexity. Exit criteria: a complete game through Cute Chess against itself or another engine without protocol errors or illegal moves.

## How to pick up a new session

1. Read this file (auto-loaded).
2. Read `docs/architecture.md` for current architectural state.
3. Read `docs/roadmap.md` for milestone status and what's next.
4. Read `docs/workflow.md` for how we collaborate.
5. Skim `docs/decisions/` for the *why* behind specific commitments.
6. Skim `docs/prior-art.md` for reference landscape — grows over time as we research each component.
7. Check git log if a repo exists.

## Ground rules (load-bearing — do not relax)

### User profile
- Chess strength ~1000 Elo. Casual player, serious engineer.
- **Does not know Rust, by design.** The language choice is a self-imposed gatekeeper to keep the work vibe-coded. The user will not be inspecting code line-by-line; chat explanations are the primary signal. Be unusually rigorous in chat about explaining decisions and surfacing risks, since bugs cannot be caught by reading.

### Interaction conventions
- **When asking the user questions, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool.** Plain-text questions in chat are easy to miss and lack a structured-choice UI; the tool surfaces the question with its options as discrete picks. Applies to clarifying requirements, choosing between approaches, or any other decision-soliciting prompt — not to status updates or summaries.

### Domain code restrictions
- **No third-party chess-domain code.** Move generation, search, eval, NNUE inference, opening-book parsers — all written from scratch.
- **No reading chess-themed source code online.** Even for inspiration. The user does not want me influenced by existing engine implementations. Browsing `github.com/.../engine/src/` is out, *even when wiki articles link to it*. The Chess Programming Wiki itself, papers, blog posts, TalkChess discussions, and articles containing illustrative code snippets are all fine — the prohibition is on browsing the *source repos* of existing engines (Stockfish, Fairy-Stockfish, Leela, any open-source Rust engine, etc.).
- **General-purpose libraries are fine**: data structures, test harnesses, parallelism primitives, CLI parsers, profiling, serialization.
- **Public chess data is encouraged**: perft suites, opening books (data files), Syzygy endgame tablebases, PGN game databases, eval test suites (STS, Bratko-Kopec, WAC).

### Workflow loop (per feature or major component)
Loop: **research → choose approach → plan → tests → implement → final review → benchmark → commit.** Runs **unattended by default** — a session goes end-to-end on a single prompt ("plan and implement M1.X") without proactive pauses. Each of the plan, test suite, and final code+tests goes through a **blind-review loop** with a fresh subagent (continued via `SendMessage` across iterations); reviewer convergence is the gate, not user approval. Plans must identify parallelization opportunities; implementation runs in parallel across coding agents per the plan. Reviewer concerns surface in chat as informational — the user can override by interjecting; absent intervention the agent proceeds.

If the agent gets genuinely stuck (ambiguous spec, hard tool failure, architectural fork contradicting ADRs), it surfaces the issue and pauses. "Uncertain" is not stuck — pick the most defensible path, note alternatives in chat, continue. See `docs/workflow.md` for the full structure and reviewer dimensions.

### Architectural commitments (settled — see `docs/decisions/`)
- Rust.
- Single-variant codebase: standard chess only. No abstraction overhead for variants.
- Bitboards, `u64`. Magic bitboards for sliding pieces.
- Classical eval first; NNUE is a planned milestone, not a "maybe." `make_move` / `unmake_move` structured as single function calls with a clean interception point so an incremental accumulator can be added without surgery.
- **Configurable strength reduction is a planned milestone.** Same hook as NNUE — eval and move selection as discrete function calls — costs nothing to preserve.
- Parallelism not from day one, but design must accommodate it.
- UCI protocol.
- **Primary platform: Apple Silicon (ARM64) macOS.** Mobile is a downstream toy target — slower/weaker is acceptable there.

### Verification standards
- TDD with perft for the rules layer.
- Property tests for search invariants.
- SPRT for any change claiming a strength impact, once the engine plays games.
- Benchmark and profile every feature.
